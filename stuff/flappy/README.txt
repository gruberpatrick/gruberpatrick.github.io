FLAPPY CLONE:
-----------------------

Based on the principle of Flappy Bird, Flappy Clone is written in HTML and JS. The only library used was jQuery. I made some tweaks, like Debugging and Cheats, to enhance the experience. I hade two hours of spare time...

1) CHEATS
Once the Cheats are enabled, the bird won't die. It flies through pipes and simply bounces off the ground. By hitting the "s" key, the speed is increased. During normal gamplay behaviour, speed is increased after every 10 pipes that have been passed. 

2) DEBUGGING
Debugging shows X and Y coordinates of the bird and space between the pipes. Not really useful for gameplay, but heavily used during development.

3) GAMEPLAY
The game is played by mouse (left click) or space-bar. This emulates a jump, made by the bird. The game ends at 99, if CHEATS are deactivated. Otherwise the game will be continuous. The output will depend on the gamplay settings (cheats enabled or not).

4) HACKABILITY
Since I'm pro open source, the game is written in a class / function model, which will enable cheating and tweaking. Have fun doing so. Please mention me in adaptions of this game, thanks.
